Designed and implemented highly available and scalable AWS environments.

**Highly Available Application using AWS**

🧩 **Description:** 
Designed and deployed a highly available, fault-tolerant cloud-based application using AWS services to minimize downtime and ensure consistent reliability across varying workloads.  

⚙️ **Tech Stack:** 
• AWS EC2 • Auto Scaling Groups • Application Load Balancer • AMI • RDS.  

🚀 **Highlights:**
• Architected a scalable infrastructure with an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and Application Load Balancer (ALB) to handle traffic spikes efficiently.
• Implemented real-time data processing for improved application responsiveness and stability.
• Enhanced system reliability and response time by deploying resources across multiple AWS regions.
• Configured monitoring and alerting with Amazon CloudWatch to maintain performance visibility.  

📊 **Outcome / Impact:** 
Achieved a robust architecture capable of self-healing and auto-scaling during peak demand, ensuring 99.9% application uptime and optimized performance.

**Three-Tier Architecture in AWS**

🧩 **Description:** 
Built and deployed a secure three-tier architecture on AWS to demonstrate cloud network design best practices — separating presentation, application, and data layers for optimal performance and security.

⚙️ **Tech Stack:** 
• AWS VPC • EC2 • RDS • Security Groups • IAM • Bastion Host • Route Tables

🚀 **Highlights:** 
• Designed isolated VPCs with public and private subnets to enforce network segmentation and controlled data flow.
• Configured a bastion host in the public subnet for secure SSH access to private instances, implementing the principle of least privilege.
• Deployed a frontend static web server in the public subnet, application layer on EC2 instances in private subnets, and a database layer using Amazon RDS within a subnet group.
• Applied security groups to tightly control inbound and outbound traffic between tiers.

📊 **Outcome / Impact:** 
Delivered a scalable and secure architecture that supports high availability, improves operational efficiency, and strengthens data protection through network isolation.
